#Dataset Description:

The Enefit competition calls upon participants to predict the energy behavior of prosumers in Estonia, individuals or businesses equipped with solar panels. The challenge involves forecasting electricity consumption or production by considering various factors such as weather data, energy prices, and installed photovoltaic capacity. Participants are required to employ time series forecasting techniques to predict the amount of electricity generated or consumed by prosumers across different segments and regions. The primary objective is to minimize imbalance costs in the energy grid.

The dataset comprises multiple files containing information on prosumer data, gas prices, client details, electricity prices, and forecasted and historical weather data. Prosumer data includes details about the county, business status, contract type, and the target variable representing energy consumption or production. Gas prices, electricity prices, and weather forecasts come with relevant dates and data block identifiers. Historical weather data provides information on temperature, dewpoint, precipitation, wind speed, and radiation, among other parameters. The challenge is to effectively utilize this diverse dataset to construct accurate models for forecasting prosumer energy patterns.

#Goal:

The objective of the Enefit competition is to create resilient time series forecasting models capable of accurately predicting the electricity consumption or production of prosumers. Participants are required to factor in the influences of weather conditions, energy prices, and photovoltaic capacity on energy patterns. The overarching goal is to minimize imbalance costs within the energy grid by delivering precise predictions. Successful solutions will demonstrate the integration of data from diverse sources, the implementation of effective forecasting algorithms, and an ability to adapt to the dynamic nature of energy consumption and production. Participants are expected to utilize regression and forecasting techniques, assess model performance, and contribute to the evolution of energy prediction methodologies.
